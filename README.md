## Core Gameplay Features and Mechanics
1. Zombies
Zombies spawn randomly from all sides to intensify the challenge for the player.

2. Valley Checkpoints
The game includes campfire checkpoints throughout the valley, serving as progression milestones and a clear path to make it to the other side.
Each checkpoint heals and restores some ammo to the player as well as is a safe space from the zombies, except for the boss zombie.

3. Zombie drops
Defeating zombies yields ammo drops, fostering resource management.

4. Health
Players take damage when zombies hit them, but can recover health by healing at checkpoints

5. Shooting bullets
Player can shoot bullets at zombies, hitting a different amount of shots kills different types of zombies.

6. Timer
Limits how much time the player actually has to beat each level, adding urgency and intensity to the game.
Reaching campfire checkpoints adds an additional 30 seconds to your timer.

7. Environmental changes 
Occasionally randomly snows affecting the player by slowing them down and making visibility more difficult, making it harder to progress.
8. Dark
Have a light shining in the direction the player is looking at.
Makes it hard for the player to know where to go
Once the player is close and has a campfire in vision, the player will go straight for the campfire.
Makes campfires more clear and obvious in the distance.

9. Faster Zombies
Once in a while spawn in order to force you to actually shoot back at the zombie otherwise these zombies will likely kill you.
However these zombie have less health and takes less shots to kill

10. Boss
Bigger and tankier than the rest of the zombies.
Is the only zombie required to defeat in order to complete the level.

11. Stealth mechanic.
Holding crouch lowers the movement speed of the player significantly but makes it nearly impossible for zombies to notice the player and pauses zombie spawns, even if the player shoots at the zombie.

12. Up the difficulty
After winning, players can increase the difficulty in order to make the game harder when playing again.
Difficulty is increased by making the zombies stronger.
